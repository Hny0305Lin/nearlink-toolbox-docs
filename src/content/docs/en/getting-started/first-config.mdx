<Aside type="caution" title="Note">We recommend that new users follow our tutorial for the first configuration to avoid unnecessary trouble!</Aside>

The NearLink ToolBox software requires some initial setup to function properly. Let's start the configuration.

## Network Settings

In the network settings, there are two configuration options: Data Source and Download Directory. For the download directory, please select a file storage directory on your computer or create a new folder. Below is the explanation for the data source configuration.

</Tabs>

**It is recommended to choose the data source with the lowest latency during your usage to ensure stability.** If you wish to use a custom source, please handle the synchronization and stability issues yourself.

## Flashing Settings

In the flashing settings, there are two configuration options: Flashing Tool Configuration and Baud Rate Settings.

### Flashing Tool Configuration

There are two flashing modes: HiSilicon Mode and Custom Mode.

- HiSilicon Mode: Uses the HiSilicon Burntool for flashing. You need to download the [Burntool](https://cucc.tj.fz.fj.nearlink-firmwares-mirrors.haohanyh.ovh:44443/?tools/burntool) and configure the executable file path in the **Flashing Tool** settings.

- Custom Mode: Uses the open-source ws63flash tool for flashing. You need to download the [ws63flash tool](https://github.com/goodspeed34/ws63flash/releases) and configure the executable file path in the **Flashing Tool** settings.

**The latest version 1.7.0 supports automatic power-on flashing, relying on the HiSilicon Burntool. It is recommended for users needing automatic power-on to choose the HiSilicon Flashing Tool.**

### Baud Rate Settings

The baud rate configuration here affects the global use of flashing ([One-click Flashing on the Browse Firmware Page](/getting-started/started#one-click-flashing), [Manual Flashing](/getting-started/started#manual-flashing), [Batch Flashing](/getting-started/started#batch-flashing)). Please configure it according to your actual usage.

<Aside type="danger">For Hi2821 chip firmware flashing, a baud rate of 115200 is required to ensure stability. For other cases, choose as needed.</Aside>

## Serial Port Settings

Configure the default parameters for serial communication, including baud rate, data bits, etc. (If you are unsure, the default configuration is the best.)

Default Configuration:

<Card title="Serial Port Configuration" icon="information">
  - Baud Rate: 115200 (recommended)
  - Data Bits: 8
  - Parity: None
  - Packet Delay: 50 (recommended)
</Card>

Default Options:

<Card title="Default Options" icon="information">
  - Auto Scroll: Enabled (automatically scrolls to the latest data when new data is received)
  - Auto Line Feed: Enabled (automatically adds a line feed at the end of sent data to ensure the serial tool can parse it correctly)
  - Show Timestamp: Enabled (displays the time before each received data)
  - Show Delay: Disabled (shows the message time interval between the board and the user)
  - Quick Command Auto Send: Enabled (automatically sends after clicking, similar to auto line feed)
</Card>
