The NearLink ToolBox software requires some initial configuration to function properly. Let's start the setup process.

## Network Settings

In the network settings, there are two configuration options: Data Source and Download Directory. For the download directory, please select a file storage directory on your computer or create a new folder. Below, we explain the data source configuration.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**It is recommended to choose the data source with the lowest resolution delay during your usage to ensure stability.** If you wish to use a custom source, please handle the synchronization and stability issues yourself.

## Burn Settings

In the burn settings, there are two configuration options: Burn Tool Configuration and Baud Rate Settings.

### Burn Tool Configuration

There are two burn modes: Hisilicon Mode and Custom Mode.

- Hisilicon Mode: Uses the Hisilicon Burntool for burning. You need to download the [Burntool](https://cucc.tj.fz.fj.nearlink-firmwares-mirrors.haohanyh.ovh:44443/?tools/burntool) and configure the executable file storage path in the **Burn Tool**.

- Custom Mode: Uses the open-source ws63flash tool for burning. You need to download the [ws63flash tool](https://github.com/goodspeed34/ws63flash/releases) and configure the executable file storage path in the **Burn Tool**.

**The latest version 1.7.0 supports automatic power-on burning, relying on the Hisilicon Burntool capabilities. It is recommended for users needing automatic power-on to choose the Hisilicon Burn Tool.**

### Baud Rate Settings

The baud rate configuration here affects global burn usage ([One-click burn on the browse firmware page](/getting-started/started#one-click-burn), [Firmware burn](/getting-started/started#manual-burn), [Batch burn](/getting-started/started#batch-burn)). Please configure according to your actual usage.

<Aside type="danger">For Hi2821 chip firmware burning, a baud rate of 115200 is recommended to ensure stability. For other cases, choose as needed.</Aside>

## Serial Port Settings

Configure the default parameters for serial communication, including baud rate, data bits, etc. (If you are unsure about the configuration, the default settings are the best.)

Default configuration is as follows:

<Card title="Serial Port Configuration" icon="information">
  - Baud Rate: 115200 (recommended)
  - Data Bits: 8
  - Parity: None
  - Packet Delay: 50 (recommended)
</Card>

Default options are as follows:

<Card title="Default Options" icon="information">
  - Auto Scroll: Enabled (automatically scrolls to the latest data when new data is received)
  - Auto Line Feed: Enabled (automatically adds a line feed at the end of sent data, ensuring the serial tool can parse it correctly)
  - Show Timestamp: Enabled (displays the time before each received data)
  - Show Delay: Disabled (shows the time interval between onboard and user messages)
  - Quick Command Auto Send: Enabled (similar to auto line feed, automatically sends after clicking)
</Card>
