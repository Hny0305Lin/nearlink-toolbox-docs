The software for NearLink ToolBox requires some initial configuration to ensure proper usage. Let's begin the setup process.

## Network Settings

For network configuration, there are two options: Data Source and Download Directory. Please choose a file storage directory on your computer or create a new folder for the download directory. Next, we will explain the data source configuration.

    <Aside type="tip" title="Developer Tip">This option is recommended for developers. Please manage your own server or device for regularly syncing our repository source!</Aside>  
  </TabItem>  
</Tabs>

**It is recommended to choose the data source with the least delay during your usage to ensure stable operation**. If you prefer using a custom source, please manage synchronization and stability on your own.

## Flashing Settings

Flashing settings have two configuration options: Flashing Tool Configuration and Baud Rate Setting.

### Flashing Tool Configuration

There are two modes for flashing: HiSilicon Mode and Custom Mode.

- **HiSilicon Mode**: Use the HiSilicon Burntool for flashing. You need to download the [Burntool](https://cucc.tj.fz.fj.nearlink-firmwares-mirrors.haohanyh.ovh:44443/?tools/burntool) and configure the executable file path in **Flashing Tool**.
  
- **Custom Mode**: Use the open-source ws63flash tool for flashing. You need to download the [ws63flash tool](https://github.com/goodspeed34/ws63flash/releases) and configure the executable file path in **Flashing Tool**.

**Version 1.7.0 supports automatic power-on flashing, relying on the HiSilicon Burntool capabilities. It is recommended for users who need automatic power-on to select the HiSilicon flashing tool.**

### Baud Rate Setting

The baud rate setting will affect the entire flashing process ([one-click flashing](/getting-started/started#one-click-flashing), [manual flashing](/getting-started/started#manual-flashing), [bulk flashing](/getting-started/started#bulk-flashing)). Please configure it based on your actual usage.

<Aside type="danger">For flashing Hi2821 chip firmware, 115200 baud rate is required for stability. For other cases, you may choose as needed.</Aside>

## Serial Port Settings

Configure the default parameters for serial communication, including baud rate, data bits, etc. (The default configuration is best if you're unfamiliar with the settings).

Default configuration:

<Card title="Serial Port Configuration" icon="information">  
  - Baud Rate: 115200 (Recommended)  
  - Data Bits: 8  
  - Parity: None  
  - Packet Delay: 50 (Recommended)  
</Card>

Default options:

<Card title="Default Options" icon="information">  
  - Auto Scroll: Enabled (Automatically scroll to the latest data when new data is received)  
  - Auto Newline: Enabled (Automatically adds a newline when sending data to ensure proper parsing by the serial tool)  
  - Show Timestamp: Enabled (Displays timestamp before each received data)  
  - Show Latency: Disabled (Shows the time gap between the board and user messages)  
  - Auto Send Quick Command: Enabled (Clicking triggers automatic sending with a newline effect)  
</Card>
