## Flash

<Aside type="tip" title="Developer Tip">The installation of the Qinheng USB driver is something you should be familiar with. Please follow the tutorial above to download and install it from the official website.</Aside>

After installing the driver, connect your NearLink development board to your computer and open the NearLink ToolBox. **The NearLink ToolBox has three methods for flashing firmware, as follows:**

<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
  This content, please be sure to move to the "[First Configuration Page](/getting-started/first-config)" to view the process needed for the first use!
  
  The NearLink ToolBox recommends using HiSilicon mode for flashing. We have fully adapted the HiSilicon Burntool flashing tool by January 2025, allowing you to experience automatic power-on flashing!
</Aside>

### One-Click Flash

* Go to the "Browse Firmware" page, select the firmware you need to use or the firmware already distributed to you. After clicking the page, you can see a brief description and file name of each firmware in the "Include Files." Click "One-Click Flash" to start flashing.

![WeChat_20250104014410.png](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/04/fQrd6Da1tcKVkqX.jpg)

![WeChat_20250104014510.png](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/04/uGOpPqTcUh68Ymj.jpg)

During the firmware flashing, please check the pop-ups in the software. After confirming, the progress bar in the new command-line window will complete the flashing.

![WeChat_20250104021200.png](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/04/y58ZeuYAzmNdf2R.jpg)

### Manual Flash

* Go to the "Firmware Flash" page, select the serial port device you need to flash in the "Serial Port Device" drop-down box, then select the firmware file to flash in the "Firmware Selection" drop-down box. **Check your flashing tool configuration to ensure it is correct. It is recommended to select HiSilicon mode and check if the flashing tool path is correct!**

![WeChat_20250104015042.png](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/04/w97PNcKFT6oWyp8.jpg)

You can also find a folder button on the right side of the "Firmware Selection" drop-down box. After clicking, select the `.fwpkg` format firmware file you need to flash, click "Open," and complete the firmware selection.

![WeChat_20250104015519.png](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/04/tGSc1RxwUpYVHZI.jpg)

![WeChat_20250104015246.png](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/04/YOxFG9v7Krg2fJt.jpg)

During the firmware flashing, please check the pop-ups in the software. After confirming, the progress bar in the new command-line window will complete the flashing.

![WeChat_20250104021200.png](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/04/y58ZeuYAzmNdf2R.jpg)

### Batch Flash

* Go to the "Batch Flash" page, select the firmware file to flash in the "Firmware Selection" drop-down box. **Check your flashing tool configuration to ensure it is correct. It is recommended to select HiSilicon mode and check if the flashing tool path is correct!**

Then check the serial port devices you need to flash in the "Available Serial Ports," set the baud rate, and click "Start Flash" or the "Batch Flash" button in the upper right corner.

![WeChat_20250104015946.png](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/04/hyc6tRg3VjJN9qs.jpg)

## Test

<Aside type="tip" title="Friendly Content">There are various types of tests, such as power-on external voltage and current tests, component tests, various trigger tests, etc. Here, our tutorial provides your serial port test.</Aside>

After your serial port is **automatically or manually powered on**, open the "Serial Port Terminal" page and carefully configure your serial port settings. Generally, the configuration is as follows:

<Card title="Serial Port Terminal Configuration" icon="information">
  - Serial Port: COMX - USB-SERIAL CH34X (COMX)
  - Data Bits: 8
  - Parity: None
  - Stop Bits: 1
  - Flow Control: None
  - Packet Delay: 50 (recommended)
  - Baud Rate: 115200 (recommended)
</Card>

![WeChat_20250104021843.png](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/04/nvDXceowOHs6T7K.jpg)

With the above configuration set correctly, you can see the normal serial port terminal content.
