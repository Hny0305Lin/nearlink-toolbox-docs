## Flashing

<Aside type="tip" title="Tip for Developers">The installation of the QinHeng USB driver is something you should be familiar with. Please follow the tutorial above to download and install from the official website.</Aside>

After installing the driver, connect your NearLink development board to the computer and open the NearLink ToolBox. **The NearLink ToolBox has three methods for flashing firmware, as follows:**

<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
  This content must be moved to the "[First Configuration Page](/getting-started/first-config)" to view the process needed for first-time use!
  
  The NearLink ToolBox recommends using the HiSilicon mode for flashing. We have fully adapted the HiSilicon Burntool flashing tool in January 2025, and you can now experience automatic power-on flashing!
</Aside>

### One-Click Flashing

* Go to the "Browse Firmware" page, select the firmware you need to use or the firmware that has been distributed to you. After clicking the page, you can see the brief information and file name of each firmware in the "Include Files". Click "One-Click Flash" to achieve flashing.
