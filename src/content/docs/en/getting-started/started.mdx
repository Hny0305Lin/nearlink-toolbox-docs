### Install Git

<Aside type="tip" title="Haohanyh Tip">Haohanyh serves every developer. In this tutorial, we **recommend you use Git and learn to manage your projects using Git during development**. For more details, please search for tutorials on your own. Below is the installation for Git on Windows!</Aside>

You can download the Git exe installer from the Git website and run it:

<LinkCard title="Click to Download" href="//git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank"/>

After downloading, double-click the installation package to open the interface and click the "next" button to begin the installation:

Once installation is complete, you can use the Git command-line tool (which includes an SSH client) and a graphical Git project management tool.

Find "Git" in the Start Menu -> "Git Bash," and the Git command window will pop up, allowing you to perform Git operations.

### SDK Code Download & Compilation

Download using Git commands. Right-click on your storage drive and select "Open Git Bash here," as shown below.

![image-20240807142741095.png]()

In the command window, enter `git clone https://gitee.com/HiSpark/fbb_ws63.git` to download the code and wait for it to finish downloading.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
    If you encounter errors, Git issues often stem from network communication problems. Please disable your proxy and try again.
    
    Alternatively, search for solutions to expand Git's buffer or resolve errors with search engines!

## Flashing

<Aside type="tip" title="Developer Tip">Installing the Qinheng USB driver is something you should be familiar with. Please follow the official tutorial to download and install it.</Aside>

After installing the driver, connect your NearLink development board to the computer, open the NearLink ToolBox. **The NearLink ToolBox offers three methods for flashing firmware, as described below:**

<Aside type="caution" title="Attention">
  Please make sure to check the "[First Configuration Page](/getting-started/first-config)" for the necessary setup process during the first use!
  
  The recommended flashing method is using the HiSilicon mode. We have fully adapted the HiSilicon Burntool flashing tool as of January 2025, enabling automatic power-on flashing!
</Aside>

### One-Click Flashing

* Go to the "Browse Firmware" page, select the firmware you need or the firmware already distributed to you. After clicking the page, you will see a brief description and file name for each firmware in "Include Files." Click "One-click Flash" to start the flashing.

![WeChat_20250104014410.png]()

![WeChat_20250104014510.png]()

During the flashing process, check the pop-up in the software. Once confirmed, the progress bar in the new command window will complete the flashing.

![WeChat_20250104021200.png]()

### Manual Flashing

* Go to the "Firmware Flashing" page, select the serial device you need from the "Serial Device" dropdown, and then select the firmware file to flash from the "Firmware Selection" dropdown. **Check that your flashing tool configuration is correct, and select HiSilicon mode for flashing. Make sure the flashing tool path is correct!**

![WeChat_20250104015042.png]()

You can also click the folder button next to "Firmware Selection" to choose the `.fwpkg` firmware file to flash. Click "Open" to complete the firmware selection.

![WeChat_20250104021200.png]()

### Batch Flashing

* Go to the "Batch Flashing" page, select the firmware file to flash from the "Firmware Selection" dropdown. **Check that your flashing tool configuration is correct, and select HiSilicon mode for flashing. Make sure the flashing tool path is correct!**

Then, check the available serial ports under "Available Serial Ports," set the baud rate, and click the "Start Flashing" button or the "Batch Flashing" button in the top-right corner.

![WeChat_20250104015946.png]()

## Testing

<Aside type="tip" title="Friendly Tip">There are various types of tests, such as external voltage and current tests, component tests, and various trigger tests. In this tutorial, we are focusing on serial port testing.</Aside>

Once your serial port is **automatically powered on or manually powered on**, open the "Serial Terminal" page and carefully configure your serial port settings. Generally, they should be configured as follows:

<Card title="Serial Terminal Configuration" icon="information">
  - Serial Port: COMX - USB-SERIAL CH34X (COMX)
  - Data Bits: 8
  - Parity: None
  - Stop Bits: 1
  - Flow Control: None
  - Package Delay: 50 (recommended)
  - Baud Rate: 115200 (recommended)
</Card>

![WeChat_20250104021843.png]()

Once the configuration is correct, you will see the normal serial terminal output.
