## Introduction  

> Haohanyh's first product featuring the Hi3863 NearLink chip solution has been brought to life.  

Haohanyh began its NearLink project in Q3 2024, from the **Hi2821 core board** to the **Hi3863 NearLink Gateway**, from the **implementation of NearLink chat software** to the **NearLink ToolBox currently under development**. While this journey has been supported by all, it also marks the start of our efforts to create **hardware and software solutions that allow more developers to experience and develop with NearLink**.  

The NearLink Gateway, released in December 2024, represents the full implementation of the Hi3863 chipâ€™s potential. Every interface and function reflects the performance of this chip, and over the past months, we've uncovered more possible features of NearLink and its potential in the future IoT landscape.  

Looking ahead, we envision the Internet of Things (IoT) integrating NearLink, led by Huawei, with the existing powerful internet infrastructure. This will connect diverse types of NearLink gateways and sensors with various functionalities and applications.  

We foresee a future IoT network where **multiple networks, various topology shapes, and interconnected sensors** will create a dedicated network, enabling users to manage everything with a single, consolidated device.  

## Preparations  

<Aside type="danger" title="Warning">All materials for the Haohanyh Hi3863 Gateway product will be open-sourced, and we plan to release them between Q1 2025 and Q2 2025. Please stay tuned.</Aside>
