## Introduction

> Haohanyh's first product to bring the Hi3863 NearLink chip solution to life as a physical product.

Since Q3 2024, Haohanyh has been working on NearLink projects, from the **Hi2821 core board** to the **Hi3863 NearLink Gateway**, from the implementation of **NLChat** to the current development of the **NearLink ToolBox**. With everyone's support, we are striving to create more hardware and software works that allow developers to experience NearLink development.

The NearLink Gateway launched in December 2024 fully leverages the performance of the Hi3863 chip, reflected in "every interface and function." We hope that through our months of hardware development, we can explore more functionalities of NearLink and envision the future of the Internet of Things (IoT).

In the future, we hope that IoT, combined with Huawei's NearLink and the existing powerful internet, will connect every form of NearLink gateway and every sensor with different functions and applications.

We envision the future IoT as a dedicated network that can connect through **multiple networks, various topologies, mutual communication, and every sensor being online**. This network will allow users to manage everything through a centralized device.

## Preparation

<Aside type="danger" title="Warning">All materials for the Haohanyh Hi3863 gateway product will be open-sourced and released between Q1 2025 and Q2 2025. Please stay tuned.</Aside>
