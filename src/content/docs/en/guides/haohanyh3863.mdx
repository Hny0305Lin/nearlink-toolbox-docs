## Introduction

> Haohanyh's first product to materialize the Hi3863 NearLink chip solution into a physical device.

Since Q3 2024, Haohanyh has been developing NearLink projects, from the **Hi2821 core board** to the **Hi3863 NearLink Gateway**, and from **implementing a NearLink chat application** to **the NearLink ToolBox currently under development**. None of this would have been possible without your support, and we are now striving to create more hardware and software projects that allow developers to experience and develop with NearLink.

The NearLink Gateway released in December 2024 fully leverages the capabilities of the Hi3863 chip, translating its theoretical performance into every interface and function. Through months of hardware development, we aim to explore more functionalities of NearLink and envision its future in the Internet of Things (IoT).

In the future, we hope that IoT, combined with Huawei's NearLink technology and the existing robust internet, will connect various forms of NearLink gateways and sensors with diverse functionalities and applications.

We envision the future IoT as a specialized network that integrates **multiple networks, various topologies, interconnected nodes, and sensors that can all access the internet**. This network will enable users to manage everything through a centralized device.

## Preparation

<Aside type="danger" title="Warning">All documentation for the Haohanyh Hi3863 gateway product will be open-sourced and released between Q1 2025 and Q2 2025. Please stay tuned.</Aside>
