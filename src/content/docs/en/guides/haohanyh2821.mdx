## Introduction

> The first hardware development board product by Haohanyh, co-produced.

The Hi2821 Core Board is a hardware development board we designed for testing the firmware functions of the Hi2821 chip in NearLink communication, facilitating ease of use and debugging. **This board adopts an external antenna solution; the reason we do not use an onboard antenna is that we aim to directly utilize a 6dB antenna gain available on the market.**
