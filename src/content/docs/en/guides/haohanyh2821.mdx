## Introduction

> Haohanyh's first hardware development board product, co-produced.

The Hi2821 core board is a hardware development board that we designed to facilitate the use and debugging of the Hi2821 chip firmware for NearLink communication testing. **This board uses an external antenna solution because we want to directly achieve a 6dB antenna gain available in the market.**
