<Aside type="note" title="Did You Know">We only truly started engaging with NearLink in Q2 of 2024. :)</Aside>  

<Card title="Project Origin" icon="information">  

Since the release of NearLink version 1.0 in November 2022, it has been made available for civilian terminal devices in September 2023. It has been over a year since its launch, and there are already more than a dozen developer-focused devices on the market for sale. *However, there is a lack of promotion and a better centralized platform for sharing universal firmware for developers*, **and more developers have chosen to share by "open-sourcing SDKs and demo projects," which lacks a clear focus on helping ordinary users understand how to operate**.  

We decided that in order for NearLink technology to be more widely adopted, **to encourage more people to use it with lower time investment and support the uncelebrated developers behind NearLink's efforts**, we would create this software to address the pain points of regular users who are unable to invest time in setting up development environments and developers who cannot promptly update and share firmware with regular users on social forums.
