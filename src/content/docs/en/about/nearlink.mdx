<Aside type="note" title="Fun Fact">We actually started working with NearLink in Q2 2024 :)</Aside>

<Card title="Project Origin" icon="information">

Since NearLink released its 1.0 standard in November 2022 and launched for consumer devices in September 2023, it has been over a year. There are now dozens of developer devices available in the market. *However, there is a lack of promotion and better centralized sharing platforms for developer-oriented universal firmware*, **and more developers choose to share through "SDK and Demo projects open source", lacking consideration for ordinary users' understanding**.

We decided to create this software to make NearLink technology more accessible, allowing more people to **use it with low time investment and support the silent developers behind NearLink development**. We aim to address the pain points of ordinary users who cannot invest time in configuring development environments and developers who cannot timely update and distribute their firmware updates through social forum platforms.
