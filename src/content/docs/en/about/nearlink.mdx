<Aside type="note" title="Trivia">We actually started to get involved with NearLink in Q2 2024. :)</Aside>

<Card title="Project Origin" icon="information">

Since the release of the 1.0 standard in November 2022, NearLink was introduced to civilian terminal devices in September 2023. More than a year has passed since its release, and there are more than a dozen developer devices available on the market. *However, there is a lack of promotion and a better centralized sharing platform for general-purpose firmware for developers*, **while more developers have chosen to share their SDKs and demo projects together, neglecting the operational understanding of ordinary users**.

We decided to create this software to make NearLink technology more accessible, to reduce the time cost for users, and to support and recognize the efforts of the developers behind NearLink development. We aim to address the pain points of ordinary users who cannot invest time in setting up development environments and developers who cannot promptly update and distribute their firmware updates to ordinary users on social forums and platforms.
