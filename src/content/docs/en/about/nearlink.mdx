<Aside type="note" title="Fun Fact">We actually started to get involved with NearLink in Q2 2024. :)</Aside>

<Card title="Project Origin" icon="information">

Since the release of the 1.0 standard in November 2022, NearLink was launched for civilian terminal devices in September 2023. It has been over a year since its release, and there are more than a dozen developer-oriented devices available on the market. *However, there is a lack of promotion and a better centralized sharing platform for general firmware aimed at developers*, **and more developers have chosen to share by "open-sourcing SDKs along with demo projects," which lacks consideration for the operational understanding of ordinary users**.

We decided that in order to make NearLink technology more accessible, **to encourage more people to use it, to use it with low time cost, and to support and recognize the efforts of the developers behind NearLink development**, we decided to create this software to address the pain points of ordinary users who cannot invest time in configuring development environments and developers who cannot promptly update and upload their firmware updates on social forums for ordinary users.
