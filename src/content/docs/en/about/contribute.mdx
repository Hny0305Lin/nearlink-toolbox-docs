### Share Serial Commands

1. Use the software's graphical interface to edit the command set.
2. Export the command set as a JSON file.
3. Add the `serialcuts` field in the `metadata.json` of the firmware directory:

```json
{
    // ... Other firmware metadata fields
    "serialcuts": [
        {
            "name": "Command Set Name",          // For example: "HH-D03 Multi-Command Set Professional Edition"
            "filename": "CommandSetFileName.json" // Corresponding JSON file in the firmware directory
        }
    ]
}
```

4. Place the command set JSON file in the corresponding firmware directory.

Note: Command sets should be used in conjunction with the firmware. Suggestions:
- Provide clear command categorization.
- Include necessary usage instructions.
- Ensure the accuracy of commands.
- Optionally provide a PDF manual for commands.
