### Share Serial Commands

1. Use the software's graphical interface to edit the command set
2. Export the command set JSON file
3. Add the serialcuts field in the metadata.json of the firmware directory:

```json
{
    // ... Other firmware metadata fields
    "serialcuts": [
        {
            "name": "Command Set Name",                // e.g., "HH-D03 Multi-Command Set Professional Edition"
            "filename": "Command Set File Name.json"   // Corresponding JSON file in the firmware directory
        }
    ]
}
```

4. Place the command set JSON file in the corresponding firmware directory

Note: The command set should be used in conjunction with the firmware, it is recommended to:
- Provide clear command classifications
