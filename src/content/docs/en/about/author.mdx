## The Story of Haohanyh Open Source Team

The Haohanyh team was established in 2018, starting from a blog and later transforming into a network team advocating for "WebSaas" cloud-based services.

Prior to this, we had extensive experience in developing projects related to blockchain, big data, IoT, and cloud service frameworks. Even before forming the team, we supported a cybersecurity team in Zhejiang with projects aimed at purifying and monitoring the Chinese internet.

During the global pandemic, the Haohanyh team struggled to sustain the "WebSaas" project, which, while providing a financial source for the entire team, eventually faced a deficit. After winning the following awards, we decided to pivot once again.

- 8th Fujian "Internet+" Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, School Level Second Prize, Provincial Level Bronze Award
- 7th Fujian "Internet+" Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, School Level Third Prize

Later, to align with our academic specialties, the Haohanyh team transitioned into an embedded development team, a focus we maintain to this day.

In 2024, in collaboration with the Sgguo team workgroup, we co-developed the NearLink ToolBox, aiming to provide development software for NearLink developers and lower the barrier to entry for NearLink users.

This journey has not been easy. Beyond the monthly "four-figure fixed expenses" and significant time-related costs, we are willing to invest so much because we believe that our efforts will pay off on December 14th.

In December 2024, we were invited to Huawei's Developer Annual Gala and received the "Huawei Developer Excellence Community Value Contribution Award." It was at that moment that our team truly felt we could "take a break."

Even though we knew **that on the 14th and 15th, we would need to spend time presenting, needing OpenSpeech, and doing many things offline**, we continued to maintain a high-intensity development pace. Our numbers are a disadvantage; we can't compete with big companies or large teams. Therefore, we prefer to sacrifice much of our desired rest time rather than miss the opportunity to introduce new features.

Having said all that, it's already a new year. The story of 2025 will continue, and we look forward to sharing more wonderful moments with you.
