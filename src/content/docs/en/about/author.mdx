## The Story of Haohanyh Open Source Team  

The Haohanyh team was established in 2018. It began with a blog and later transformed into an online team advocating for "WebSaaS" cloud-based services.  

Prior to this, we already had extensive development experience in blockchain, big data, IoT, cloud service frameworks, and more. Before forming the team, we had also supported the construction of projects related to China’s internet purification and internet monitoring for a cybersecurity team in Zhejiang.  

During the global pandemic, the Haohanyh team worked hard to sustain the "WebSaaS" project, which provided an economic foundation for the entire team. However, as time passed, the resources became insufficient. After receiving the following prestigious awards, we decided to transition again:  

- 8th "Internet+" Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition of Fujian Province, second prize in the school competition, bronze prize in the provincial competition  
- 7th "Internet+" Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition of Fujian Province, third prize in the school competition  

In line with our professional expertise, the Haohanyh team transitioned into an embedded development team, and continues in this direction to this day.  

In 2024, to collaborate with the Sgguo team, we co-developed the NearLink ToolBox, dedicated to providing development support software for NearLink developers and lowering the entry barrier for NearLink users.  

It hasn’t been easy. Beyond the monthly "four-figure fixed expenses" and the considerable time costs, we were willing to make such efforts because we believe that all this hard work would be rewarded on December 14th.  

In December 2024, we were invited to attend the Huawei Developer Annual Gala and received the "Huawei Developer Excellence Community Value Contribution Award." At that moment, our entire team felt like we could finally "take a break."  

Even though we knew that **on December 14th and 15th, we would need to spend time on speeches, OpenSpeech, and a lot of offline activities**, we still maintained our intense development work. We are at a disadvantage in terms of team size and resources compared to large enterprises, so we chose to sacrifice much of our desired rest time rather than miss the opportunity to launch new features.  

With that said, it’s already a new year. The story of 2025 continues, and we look forward to witnessing more wonderful moments together with you.
