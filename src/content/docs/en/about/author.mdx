## The Story of Haohanyh Open Source Team

The Haohanyh team was established in 2018, starting from a blog and later transforming into a network team advocating "WebSaas" cloud-based services.

Prior to this, we had extensive experience in developing projects related to blockchain, big data, IoT, and cloud service frameworks. Even before forming the team, we supported the construction of China's internet purification and monitoring projects for a cybersecurity team in Zhejiang.

During the global pandemic, the Haohanyh team struggled to sustain the "WebSaas" project, which provided the team with a financial source but eventually faced a deficit. After winning the following awards, we decided to pivot once again.

- Eighth Fujian "Internet+" Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, Second Prize at the University Level, Bronze Award at the Provincial Level
- Seventh Fujian "Internet+" Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, Third Prize at the University Level

Later, to align with our academic expertise, the Haohanyh team transitioned into an embedded development team, a focus we maintain to this day.

In 2024, in collaboration with the Sgguo team, we co-developed the NearLink ToolBox, aiming to provide development software for NearLink developers and lower the entry barrier for NearLink users.

This journey has not been easy. Beyond the monthly "four-figure fixed expenses" and significant time investments, we are willing to make these sacrifices because we believe our efforts will pay off on December 14th.

In December 2024, we were invited to Huawei's Developer Annual Gala and received the "Huawei Developer Excellence Community Value Contribution Award." At that moment, our team could finally take a breather.

Even though we knew **we would need to spend time presenting on the 14th and 15th, prepare OpenSpeech, and handle many offline tasks**, we continued our intense development work. Our small team size is a disadvantage compared to large enterprises and teams, so we chose to sacrifice much-needed rest time rather than miss opportunities to roll out new features.

With all that said, it's a new year. The story of 2025 will continue, and we look forward to sharing more wonderful moments with you.
